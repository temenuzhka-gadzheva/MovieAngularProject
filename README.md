# OnlineMoviesApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.0.

Course project developed with the knowledge of Angular acquired at the university. It is a system for viewing, creating, editing, liking and deleting movies. We use json to store movies and users. We have pre-registered users through whom we can use all the functionality of the system. Everyone can like a movie, after marking it as such, they see detailed information about the respective movie. When we are registered we can create and edit movies.
